Finally! FCMC has a website! We get so many questions about what we're doing that we decided that a web page would be the best resource to point people to.  However, because we're all super busy, it's taken a while to get it done.  At long last, however, we're proud to announce the new Fairfield County Minecraft website.

As you've probably noticed, there are three sections on here: players, parents, and libraries.  This is so that you can go directly to the part of the website that is most useful to you.  If you're a player, you're probably not going to be very interested in the same things your parents are, and who can blame you? If you're a parent, you're probably going to have no idea what your son or daughter means when they exclaim, "OMG, I got griefed and someone stole all my budder!", so we'll have a section that breaks it down for you and also explains all the measures we take to keep your kids safe.  Finally, if you're a librarian, you may want to know how to join FCMC, or if you are a participating library, you'll want to use that section to keep up-to-date with what's going on. If you're from a library outside Fairfield County, that's the section you'll go to if you want to know "how in the heck are they doing that??"

So, welcome and enjoy!
