					<span class="pageitem"><h4>Joining FCMC</h4>
					Joining FCMC is easy and free.  Well, if your library doesn't already have a staff-only Minecraft account, then it's going to cost you $27. We take care of the rest.  What's the catch? No catch--this is a cooperative effort. As a member, you will be responsible for the care and tending of your players.  You will add them to the server and prune them as they age out. We ask that you spend an hour or two each week hanging out on the server so that we increase the number of adults online, especially in the afternoon.
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="pageitem"><h4>Getting Started</h4>
					You are encouraged to have some internal discussion about your roles and responsibilities as a member before joining. As mentioned, they are not burdensome at all, however, it is still a commitment.  Once you are ready to take the plunge, you will need to have at least one staff member (typically the project lead) undergo a 90 minute orientation which is usually hosted at Darien Library.  During this orientation, you will learn how to whitelist players and add them to your town. [under construction]

					<span class="pageitem"><h4>Setting Up a Minecraft Server</h4>
					We get many inquiries from libraries all over the world asking how we went about setting up a Minecraft server for our kids and teens. It's not an easy answer to give because it is a very complex process with dozens of variables such as, what kind of server do you want to run? Do you want it to be open to the public? Will it be open 24x7? Will it be accissible from the outside world, or just within the library?  My first question is always, "have you played Minecraft?".  If the answer is no, your first step should be to download Minecraft, purchase an account and begin playing.  If you don't know what all the fuss is about, then you're probably not quite ready to run a server.
